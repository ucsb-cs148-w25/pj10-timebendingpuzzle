I used ChatGPT (GPT4o) for camera tracking logic in our Unity 2D game
### Outcomes Produced
- Generated C# script for camera following behavior
- Implemented screen-edge buffer zone detection
- Added smooth damping movement
Instead of fixing the center of the camera on the player, this script allows the camera to follow the player in a smart way.
The camera moves only if the player trespasses 1/4 screen length from the edge of the window. This makes the camera movement
smoother, improving gaming experience.

AI used: Chatgpt (Canvas), DALL-E 3
What I used for: For our game, I used ChatGPTâ€™s Canvas feature to enhance the UI design and DALL-E 3 to generate concept art. My goal is 
to improve the current design of the main page UI. I started by uploading the UI design in MVP to ChatGPT Canvas, where I received AI-driven 
suggestions on layout improvements, button placements, and visual hierarchy. The AI provided insights on making the interface more intuitive 
and readable, which helped refine the player experience.I also used DALL-E 3 to generate a background picture.
