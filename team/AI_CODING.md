- **AI Tool Utilized:** [ChatGPT (GPT-4)](https://openai.com/chatgpt)
- **Experiment:**  
  I leveraged ChatGPT to generate well-structured, aesthetically pleasing markdown documentation. I always take help of ChatGPT to write down beautiful and detailed markdown, which includes clear headings, bullet points, and code blocks.
- **Outcome Produced:**  
  ChatGPT provided a markdown template that was both easy to read and edit. This allowed me to quickly produce documentation that is organized and adheres to our project’s style guidelines. The final output was not only visually appealing but also semantically correct, making it simpler for team members to understand and modify.
- **Reflections:**
  - **Usefulness:**  
    ChatGPT proved to be a valuable tool for drafting documentation. Its ability to generate detailed markdown saves time and ensures consistency in our documentation style across the team.
  - **Ensuring Correctness & Understandability:**  
    After receiving the markdown output, I reviewed the content to ensure it accurately reflected our project details and met our documentation standards. I performed minor edits to adjust formatting and content, ensuring it was both correct and easy to follow.

I used ChatGPT (GPT4o) for camera tracking logic in our Unity 2D game
**Outcomes Produced**
- Generated C# script for camera following behavior
- Implemented screen-edge buffer zone detection
- Added smooth damping movement
Instead of fixing the center of the camera on the player, this script allows the camera to follow the player in a smart way.
The camera moves only if the player trespasses 1/4 screen length from the edge of the window. This makes the camera movement
smoother, improving gaming experience.

AI used: Chatgpt (Canvas), DALL-E 3
What I used for: For our game, I used ChatGPT’s Canvas feature to enhance the UI design and DALL-E 3 to generate concept art. My goal is 
to improve the current design of the main page UI. I started by uploading the UI design in MVP to ChatGPT Canvas, where I received AI-driven 
suggestions on layout improvements, button placements, and visual hierarchy. The AI provided insights on making the interface more intuitive 
and readable, which helped refine the player experience.I also used DALL-E 3 to generate a background picture.

AI used: ChatGPT
Outcome: I used ChatGPT to help generate code for the visual oscillation on the player character while using the rewind feature. ChatGPT has been very useful for Unity development because, while many of the functions are fairly straightfoward, I have not used Unity prior to this project. This has helped me get more famililar with the specific classes used by Unity and how they are linked to various scripts and the graphical editor. When it came time to write the flashing effect I had the idea to adjust the sprite color in a loop. ChatGPT helped me generate a clever line of code using a sin function so that the color value oscillates between a specified range. It a gave me better insight into the functions that can be used to manipulate sprites and color. Testing was a fairly simple process of first making sure that the sprite color was changing as expected, and then applying the oscillation effect to the loop that controls player rewinding. Going forward I can carry this experience into some of our other sprites and effects. For example, having the player flash red when they take damage or having a different visual effect when objects move through time, rather than the player.

AI used: ChatGPT
Outcome: ChatGPT was helpful in identifying common mistakes in Unity and explaining why certain errors occurred. It provided alternative solutions that improved my understanding of Unity’s scripting workflow. I also use AI to help me design UI for our game. While ChatGPT provided useful design suggestions, it lacked deep visualization capabilities. It worked best for conceptual guidance rather than detailed UI layouts.
