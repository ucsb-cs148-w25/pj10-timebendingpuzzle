AI used: Chatgpt (Canvas), DALL-E 3
What I used for: For our game, I used ChatGPTâ€™s Canvas feature to enhance the UI design and DALL-E 3 to generate concept art. My goal is 
to improve the current design of the main page UI. I started by uploading the UI design in MVP to ChatGPT Canvas, where I received AI-driven 
suggestions on layout improvements, button placements, and visual hierarchy. The AI provided insights on making the interface more intuitive 
and readable, which helped refine the player experience.I also used DALL-E 3 to generate a background picture.
