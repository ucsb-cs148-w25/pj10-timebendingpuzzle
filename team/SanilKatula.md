# Puzzle-Based Time Travel Game Concept

## **About Me**
- **Sanil Katula:**
  - A Computer Science student with previous experience in Unity development.
  - Created an archery game for VR, showcasing skills in immersive gameplay and interactive mechanics.

## **Theme and Setting**
- **A Futuristic Lab or Mystical World:**
  - The environment could feature a mix of clean, futuristic elements (e.g., glowing panels, holographic displays) or a mystical look (e.g., ancient ruins with magical glyphs).
- **Dynamic Lighting:**
  - Subtle lighting effects to emphasize moments of time manipulation (e.g., glowing trails for rewound objects or characters).

## **Player and Controls**
- **Third-Person View (or Isometric):**
  - The player can control a character or interact with the environment using point-and-click or standard movement keys.
- **Minimalist UI:**
  - A simple timer or energy meter in the corner to show time-travel capabilities.

## **Core Gameplay Mechanics**
1. **Interactive Puzzles:**
   - Doors, platforms, and levers that require precise sequences to solve.
   - Objects that change state over time (e.g., plants growing, walls crumbling).

2. **Rewind Feature:**
   - A glowing rewind effect when you go back in time.
   - Visual trails showing where objects were before the rewind.
   - A cooldown or limited energy to prevent overuse.

3. **Time-Locked Objects:**
   - Certain objects or enemies might remain unaffected by time rewinds, adding layers of complexity.

## **Visual Design**
- **Environment:**
  - Clean, well-lit areas with puzzle elements like moving platforms, pressure plates, or time-sensitive gates.
- **Rewind Animation:**
  - A subtle glowing or reverse motion blur effect to visually convey time going backward.
- **Audio:**
  - Echo-like sound effects for rewinding actions and mechanical or magical sound cues for puzzle solutions.

## **Game Progression**
- **Levels:**
  - Each puzzle grows more complex, introducing new mechanics (e.g., controlling multiple objects at different times).
- **Narrative:**
  - A story tied to recovering fragments of time, perhaps to correct a catastrophic event.
- **Challenges:**
  - Players must carefully manage when and how they rewind to solve increasingly intricate puzzles.
