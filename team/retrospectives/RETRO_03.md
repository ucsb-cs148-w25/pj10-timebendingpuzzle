Retrospective â€“ March 7, 2025
Led by: Tom Shangguan
Attendees: Rui Tong, Sam Bian, Mukun Zhou, Jason Vu, Mike Petrus, Montgomery Forde
Absent: Sanil Katula

**Action Items**

Objective: The team continues to focus on improving efficiency, maintaining clear communication, and ensuring that 
everyone stays aligned with project objectives. By reinforcing best practices, we aim to further minimize miscommunication 
and enhance team productivity.

Change Implemented: Based on feedback from the last retrospective, we are introducing a structured update schedule in Slack.
Major project updates, task assignments, and critical information will now be shared in a dedicated "Team Updates" thread 
every Monday and Thursday. Team members are expected to acknowledge these updates and raise any questions within 24 hours. 
This structured approach should reduce scattered communication and improve information retention.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

Engagement: Monitoring the frequency and consistency of Slack acknowledgments and follow-ups.
Task Completion: Assessing whether assignments are completed more efficiently with fewer instances of overlooked updates.
Results: The structured update schedule has improved communication clarity and reduced the number of missed updates. More
team members are engaging with Slack updates in a timely manner, leading to better alignment. However, some delays in 
acknowledgments were noted, particularly over weekends. Moving forward, we will explore setting automated reminders and 
refining response expectations to maintain consistency.
