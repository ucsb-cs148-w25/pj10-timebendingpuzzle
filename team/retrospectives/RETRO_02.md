Action Items
Goal:
The team aims to improve overall efficiency, maintain clear and consistent communication, and ensure that everyone is aligned with the project’s objectives. By keeping all members informed, we can minimize misunderstandings and work more cohesively toward our common goals.

Change:
To enhance communication and accountability, all team members are required to acknowledge updates in the Slack channel. This includes major project changes, new assignments, or any information that requires individual action. By doing so, we can ensure that everyone is on the same page and that no critical information is overlooked.

Measurement:
Our progress will be evaluated based on two key factors:

Efficiency: We will assess whether we are completing tasks more quickly and making measurable progress in a shorter time frame.
Timeliness: We will track whether team assignments are submitted on time and without penalties, ensuring that deadlines are met consistently.
By implementing these changes, we hope to create a more structured and productive workflow that benefits the entire team.
