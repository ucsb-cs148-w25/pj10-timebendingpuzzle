Tom Shangguan - Third Year CS

I had taken CS156 before. I never use Unity before, but I'm willing to learn.

Ideas for the project:

- 2D Game where the world is divided into distinct yet interconnected areas, each with unique challenges and different NPCs. 
- The player borns with the ability to  stop time and rewind time to dodge attacks from NPCs.
- Save points, like the bonfires in Dark Souls, act as respawn locations and places to recover resources.
- The player can rewind time to a point just before the fatal event occurred. This comes at a cost such as a specific item. Or, the player can respawn at the saving point.

Games that can infer: Dark Souls, Hollow Knight
