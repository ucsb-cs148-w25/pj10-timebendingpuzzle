# Team Evaluation Response Report

## 1. Decisions Regarding Feedback on USER_FEEDBACK_NEEDS.md

Based on the feedback we received, we are making the following decisions regarding our key gameplay mechanics:

- **Time Reversal Mechanics:**
  - We will allow both the player and objects to be reversed in time. However, we may explore levels where one mechanic is restricted to add variety to puzzles.

- **Idle Time & Time Reversal:**
  - We will implement skipping idle time during reversal by default, as this was the most preferred option. However, we will add a visual effect showing past positions to maintain player intuition.

- **Walking Sound Effects:**
  - Most players found the walking sound satisfactory, but we will explore adding different sound effects based on floor types to enhance immersion.

- **End Game Experience:**
  - Several suggestions included a cinematic or a time loop ending. We plan to implement a cinematic ending while incorporating time reversal elements to reinforce the gameâ€™s theme.

- **Future Levels & Enemies:**
  - There was strong support for adding enemies and bosses. We will prioritize adding simple enemies with potential mechanics that interact with time reversal.

- **User Experience Improvements:**
  - The biggest concerns were around navigation, instructions, and UI clarity. We will implement a tutorial system and improve instructions when interacting with objects (e.g., pop-ups for key prompts). We will also tweak the jump mechanics to be more responsive.

## 2. Additional Decisions Based on Other Feedback

### (1) Features and Improvements
- **Summary of Feedback:**
  - Players liked the time reversal mechanics and level design but suggested improvements such as adding checkpoints and refining hitboxes.
- **Planned Actions:**
  - We will add checkpoints at critical parts of levels to improve the flow and reduce frustration.
  - We will adjust hitboxes to be more precise, especially in interactions with traps and obstacles.

### (2) Effectiveness of the Current State of the Project
- **Summary of Feedback:**
  - The game was enjoyable and robust, but some players found navigation unclear.
- **Planned Actions:**
  - Implement an interactive tutorial in the first level to guide players through core mechanics.
  - Add on-screen prompts when approaching objects that require interaction.

### (3) Repository Structure and Deployment
- **Summary of Feedback:**
  - The Kanban board had large issues that could be broken into smaller tasks.
  - README lacked detailed installation and control instructions.
- **Planned Actions:**
  - Restructure the Kanban board by breaking down larger tasks into smaller, clearer user stories.
  - Improve the README by adding clear installation steps, gameplay instructions, and key mappings.

### (4) Final Thoughts and Additional Feedback
- **Summary of Feedback:**
  - The game concept was praised, but adding a WebGL version would make it more accessible.
- **Planned Actions:**
  - We will explore deploying a WebGL version to make the game playable online.
  - We will refine UI elements based on additional playtesting to ensure clarity and ease of use.
