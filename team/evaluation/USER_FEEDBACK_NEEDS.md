User Feedback Needs

We’re gathering feedback to improve our game experience. Please share your thoughts on the following aspects, ranked by priority:

Time Reversal Mechanics – Should players be able to reverse time on both objects and themselves?

Idle Time & Time Reversal – When a player is idle, should time reversal skip those moments or include them?

Walking Sound Effects – How do the current sound effects for walking feel? Would you like any changes?

End Game Experience – What would your ideal ending sequence look like? (E.g., cinematic, interactive, open-ended, etc.)

Future Levels & Enemies – Would you like to see enemies in later levels? If so, what types?

User Experience Improvements – What aspects of the UI/UX could be better? Are there any pain points in navigation, controls, or interactions?
