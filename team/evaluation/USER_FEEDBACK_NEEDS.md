User Feedback

We are looking for user feedback on the following aspects of our product, listed in priority order:

Death Mechanics

Should the game restart from the beginning upon death, or should the game end immediately?

We would like to understand player preferences regarding these two options and their impact on game enjoyment and engagement.

Trap Mechanics

Should falling into a trap result in instant death, or should it only reduce the player's health?

Feedback on how this affects difficulty balance and player experience would be valuable.

Jumping Mechanics

Should the character have the ability to double jump or be limited to a single jump?

We want to gauge user preference and how this affects gameplay fluidity and challenge.
